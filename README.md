# Head Tracking with Kinect

This application tracks a person’s head by means of the Microsoft Kinect and sends its coordinates over the (local) network via UDP.

## Requirements

You will need a Windows 10 machine with a ‘Kinect 2 for Windows’ device connected and functioning.  
Be aware: because Microsoft has screwed up with the hardware and software requirements, this is not easy to achieve.


## Usage

Just run the Visual Studio solution.

## Meta
